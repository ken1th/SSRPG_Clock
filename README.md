# Stone Story RPG Digital Clock UI

Elevate your device with this script, transforming it into a captivating digital clock set against the vibrant world of Stone Story RPG. Dive deep into the game's narrative while the current time, artfully rendered in ASCII art digits, seamlessly integrates into the heart of your screen. This Stonescript doesn't just tell time; it enhances your gaming experience by marrying practicality with the spellbinding essence of your journey.

## Features

- Displays hours and minutes in the center of the game screen using ASCII art.
- Easy to activate and deactivate the clock UI with a single variable.
- Customizable start time: Set the loop when the clock UI becomes visible.
- Rainbow-colored ASCII art digits for enhanced visibility and aesthetics.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Stone Story RPG installed and have access to the Mind Stone for custom scripting.
2. Open your Mind Stone interface in the game.
3. Copy the Stonescript code from SSRPG_clock_script in this repository.
4. Paste the code into the Mind Stone script area in the game.
5. Exit the Mind Stone interface, start a game loop, and enjoy the digital clock UI.

## Usage

The digital clock UI starts displaying based on the `loopClockStart` variable. By default, the clock UI activates on the second loop but can be customized as needed.

- `clockUI`: Set to `true` to enable the clock UI, or `false` to disable it.
- `loopClockStart`: Determine on which loop the clock UI should start being displayed.
- `startX` and `posY`: Adjust these variables to change the clock's position relative to the center of the screen.

## Customization

You can customize the ASCII art for each digit by modifying the `GetDigitArt` function. Each digit's art is defined within its case in the function. Adjust the ASCII art as desired for personalization or better visibility.
